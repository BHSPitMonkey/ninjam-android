# NINJAM for Android

A (work-in-progress) NINJAM client for Android.

## Status

Only some UI pieces and flow are in place currently.
The Service which will represent an active connection to a server needs a lot of work and careful planning.

## Development

[Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) is recommended.
Pull requests are welcome.
